### Goal


I will type in a word and the program should tell me what the next possible word could be. 

For example, if I type “I”, the program should tell me that the next possible words could be: 1) love 2) am 3) will 4) adore 5) hate 

(probabistically in this order). We will call the order of words as ranking.

Subsequently, if I type “I love”, the program should tell me that the next word could be: 1) the 2) my 3) and 4) doing.  

If I type in the word “I love the”, your program should tell me that the next word could be (in ranking): 1) way 2) my 3) work 4) beauty.

Limit yourself to the combinations of 4 words only.

Your program should also print a random sentence.  

For example, I will give a word (say “I”). Your program should automatically print a sentence having three words.
